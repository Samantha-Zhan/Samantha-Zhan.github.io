The employment requirement varies with the company. Bigger corporation like Google, for instance, regularly lean toward candidates who have earned a four-year university degree. On the other hand, numerous new businesses are concerned less with qualifications and more with what hard abilities a candidate has.

<!-- Women in Tech -->
<h2 class="h2">Women in Tech</h2>
<p class="p" style="padding-bottom:30px;">
There is a need to stress one particular group of people working in tech -- women. Although our society is much open and equal than the past in terms of gender difference, statistics still show that there are much fewer women than men in technology-related careers and mistreatments still exist in the workforce on women. Wage inequality compared to male colleagues, workplace gender bias and a shortage of female role models are among the main barriers faced by women working in the technology field, according to a survey by global technology association ISACA.
</p>
<p class="p2" style="padding-bottom:15px;">
"The Future Tech Workforce: Breaking Gender Barriers" report identified the top five barriers experienced by women in tech as:
</p>
<ol class="p2" style="padding-bottom:10px; padding-left:125px;">
<li>Lack of mentors <ins style="color:tomato;">(48 percent)</ins></li>
<li>Lack of female role models in the field<ins style="color:tomato;">(42 percent)</ins></li>
<li>Gender bias in the workplace <ins style="color:tomato;">(39 percent)</ins></li>
<li>Unequal growth opportunities compared to men <ins style="color:tomato;">(36 percent)</ins></li>
<li>Unequal pay for the same skills <ins style="color:tomato;">(35 percent)</ins></li>
</ol>
